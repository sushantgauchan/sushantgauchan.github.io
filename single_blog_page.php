                    <p>OnePlus has exclusively confirmed to TechRadar that its next handset (rumored to be the OnePlus 6T) will not have a headphone jack, but will feature improved battery life. It's also just launched a USB-C version of its Bullets V2 headphones.</p>
                    <p>The OnePlus 6T launch is probably not too far off – assuming the Chinese firm continues to follow its half-yearly release schedule for its affordable flagship smartphones.</p>
                    <p>The OnePlus 6 was another successful phone in the range, managing to match handsets almost twice its price. It was an exciting phone, so can you blame us for being excited about what’s coming next?</p>
                    <p>There aren't too many OnePlus 6T leaks or rumors about at the moment, but we'll be constantly updating this page whenever we hear something new.</p>
                    <p>In the meantime, here's what we know, what we think we know, and what we'd like to see from the new OnePlus phone.</p>
                    <p>Cut to the chase</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>What is it? The next T-variant flagship from OnePlus</li>
                        <li>When is it out? Likely November 2018</li>
                        <li>What will it cost? Probably at least $529 / £469 (around AU$840)</li>
                        <li>OnePlus 6T release date and price</li>
                        <li>The OnePlus 6T release date is likely to be around November 2018, as that's when the OnePlus 5T arrived last year, and the OnePlus 3T in 2016.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>It would be the firm's third 'T' variant device, as it looks to bridge the gap between its new-number launches in June.</p>
                    <p>The OnePlus 6T may arrive a month earlier though, with a separate report claiming that the handset will launch in October.</p>
                    <img src="https://cdn.gillion.shufflehound.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/2c-1200x675.jpg">
                    <p>However, there's a suggestion that the OnePlus 6T may not launch at all this year, due to a lack of new, cutting -edge features being available to make it worthwhile.</p>
                    <p>We'd say that's pretty unlikely as the company has found a nice rhythm in its six monthly cycle, and with no OnePlus 6T launch in November it doesn't give the firm much to talk about and keep itself relevant - which can be difficult when you have just one handset to market.</p>
                    <p>That said, OnePlus has posted a teaser suggesting that something will be announced on January 15, so it's possible that this will be the OnePlus 6T, but we'd still say it's unlikely.</p>
                    <p>There’s no word currently on the OnePlus 6T price, but the OnePlus 6 started at $529 / £469 (around AU$840) and prices have been gradually creeping up since the range began, so we expect the OnePlus 6T will cost at least that much, if not slightly more.</p>
